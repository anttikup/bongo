Cleff tells us where each note is located on the staff. The most common cleff is the treble cleff, or g cleff.

Mnemonic:

The whirl of the treble cleff points to the note gยน. It is usually on the second line reading from bottom up.

Mnemonic:

Notes between the lines spell out the word FACE from bottom to top.
